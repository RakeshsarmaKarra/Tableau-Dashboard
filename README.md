## A Study on Pantawid Indigenous People (IP) Data

## Abstract:
In this Research, we are doing an analysis on the Pantawid Indigenous people (IP) data which investigates the social and economic traits and wellbeing results of Indigenous peoples in the Philippines. These people are frequently excluded and subjected to socioeconomic inequality, making it necessary to implement specific programs to meet their basic needs. The purpose of this study is to shed light on the Demographics, Education, and healthcare of IP communities.
The study requires data like number of people actively registered for the program from different Regions, Province, City/Municipality and Barangay according to the age and gender variations. The focus of the study is to implement methods to alter the Conditional Cash Transfer program to a Modified Conditional Cash Transfer program which is a part of Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program helps more to the homeless and indigenous people. The analysis provides insights into the demographic composition of the IP areas who are involved in the MCCT program, differences in access to healthcare and education, based on that we can able to provide some insights on the policy proposals, budget allocation, financial aids to enhance socioeconomic results. 

## Description of the Project:
The Indigenous people are a broad category of ethnic groups with distinctive socioeconomic backgrounds and a variety of cultural legacies. These people in Philippines face a lot of issues, such as poverty, exclusion, and access to basic services. So, the government has introduced some social welfare schemes like the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino program (4Ps) to promote the well-being of under privileged communities, particularly Indigenous people, after realizing the necessity for specific measures to address the issues. This program was initiated in the year 2007 and implemented its first phase in 2008 with a set of 7545 households from 4 municipalities which was implemented by Department of Social and Welfare Development (DSWD) that includes Department of Health, Department of Education and Social welfare.
The MCCT (Modified Conditional Cash Transfer) is a part of this program implemented to reach the very poor families who are not covered by the Conditional Cash Transfer program. The main aim of this program is to reduce the poverty and make the children who are between 0-18 years of age educated, nutrition and healthy for a better future. The Beneficiary of the program is selected through a targeting system survey knows as Listahanan based on their structure of house, access to the basic needs. The 4Pâ€™s program is 4th largest welfare program in the world with most of the population covered from this country. The Cash grants are categorized into 2 parts, one for the Education and the other for healthcare benefits.

## Objectives of the study:
o	The main objective of the program is to allocate the resources based on their basic needs, age groups and gender.

o	To enhance the quality of preventative healthcare for young children and pregnant mothers.

o	To improve the number of students registered in and attending the school.

o	To eradicate the child labor and improve the average food expenditure. 

o	Show the visualizations of demographics of the people registered for the MCCT program based on different age groups and gender.

o	To show top N City/Province that have the highest number of people registered for the program.

## Conclusion:
From our analysis of Pantawid Indigenous People data, we found that total 0-5 years aged children including both Male and Female count is very less compared to remaining age groups. Among all age groups and gender, the 19+ years aged females are high in almost all Regions, Provinces, Cities and Barangays. The Provinces like Catandaunes, Siquijor, Eastern Samar are having the very total least count and, in these areas, the government can create awareness among the people about the benefits of the program. The Target audience like Assistant secretary and program managers and coordinators can make use of the analysis like where the count is low and where it is high along with the age and gender ration, they can modify the program outlines and implement new schemes for the wellbeing of beneficiaries.
