# A Study on Pantawid Indigenous People (IP) Data
## Abstract
In this research, we are doing an analysis on the Pantawid Indigenous People (IP) data, which investigates the social and economic traits and well-being results of Indigenous peoples in the Philippines. These people are frequently excluded and subjected to socioeconomic inequality, making it necessary to implement specific programs to meet their basic needs.

The purpose of this study is to shed light on **Demographics, Education, and Healthcare** of IP communities. The study requires data such as: Number of people actively registered for the program from different **Regions, Provinces, Cities/Municipalities, and Barangays**.

Data categorized by age and gender variations.
The focus of the study is to implement methods to modify the Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) program into a Modified Conditional Cash Transfer (MCCT) program, which is a part of the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps) that helps homeless and indigenous people.

The analysis provides insights into:                                                                                                                                
📊 Demographic composition of the IP areas involved in the MCCT program.                                                                                
🏥 Differences in access to healthcare and education.                                                                                                            
📢 Policy proposals, budget allocation, and financial aid recommendations to enhance socioeconomic outcomes.                                                              

## Description of the Project
Indigenous people in the Philippines belong to diverse ethnic groups with distinctive socioeconomic backgrounds and cultural legacies. They face major challenges such as poverty, exclusion, and lack of access to basic services.

To address these issues, the government introduced social welfare schemes like the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps) in 2007, implemented by the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) in collaboration with:

- Department of Health
- Department of Education
- Social Welfare Department
  
🔹The first phase of the program started in 2008 with 7,545 households across four municipalities.                                                                   
🔹The Modified Conditional Cash Transfer (MCCT) program is an extension of 4Ps, specifically designed for the poorest families not covered under the Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) program.

## Main Aim of MCCT                                                                                                      
✅ Reduce poverty among Indigenous people.                                                                                
✅ Ensure education, nutrition, and healthcare for children aged 0-18 years.                                                       
✅ Targeting system survey (Listahanan) helps identify beneficiaries based on house structure and access to basic needs.
